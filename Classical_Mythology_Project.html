            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Medea, a formidable sorceress in Greek mythology, is renowned for her tragic tale of love, betrayal, and vengeance. She played a pivotal role in helping the hero Jason obtain the Golden Fleece, using her magical powers to assist him in overcoming daunting challenges. However, after years of marriage, Jason betrays Medea by marrying another woman, Glauce. Consumed by rage and heartbreak, Medea exacts her revenge by murdering their two children and Glauce, shattering Jason’s happiness forever. Medea’s actions, driven by profound emotional turmoil and betrayal, cement her as one of the most complex and tragic figures in Greek mythology.

                For this project, I have sought to capture Medea’s emotional journey of heartbreak and vengeance through the lens of modern music, particularly focusing on contemporary female pop artists. Each song in the curated playlist is thoughtfully chosen to mirror Medea’s internal struggle and emotional arc, taking you on a powerful journey through her pain and fury.
